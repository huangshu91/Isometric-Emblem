Isometric-Emblem
================

TODO: 
	Gamestates
	Menu/OverlayBox/GUI
		- Frames done, need to redo graphic for accurate sizes (and smaller border)
		- future: system to change fill color and border color (get pixel, replace all)
	Entities
	Rethink how GUI works.  Might not be necessary to have flexible GUIDisplay/GUIFrame
		- work on specific GUI widgets that are actually going to be used
	
FUTURE:
	Mouse control scheme (point in polygon)
	Font manager if more than one font is used. (including same font different sizes?)
	
NOTES:
	build release with -mwindows so no console + crash on exit
	something buggy about fonts, will figure out when they are added
